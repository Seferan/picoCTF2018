based on the above, bytes 1080 and 1081 should be 0x53 and 0xEF in order to be a proper ext2/ext3/ext4 file system.

sudo apt-get install ghex

COntrol + J = go to byte

change to 53 and 3F

After saving running file ext-super-magic.img will give valid data

mkdir mountpoint
mount ext-super-magic.img mountpoint/
cd mountpount/
